# Knife-Sharpening-Guide
An Arduino based project to assist in keeping a consistent grinding angle.

Having recently finished building, setting up, and toubleshooting my PC, I figured starting a neew project should be my next step. Get to prevent my electronics skills from getting rusty, find all the productivity programs I need to install, and to curb my abject and growing bordem.

On the side, I was also learning my way around the kitchen which of course includes keeping all the knives sharp. Noticed they began dulling, so I took out my grindstone set hoping to rehone the edges; grind, wash, grind, wash, repeat, repeat, paper test… still made the cut, but not as smooth as I hoped and as I already done after a previous session. Huh…. Had a good, disatisfied peer down along the edge, the light just about catch the bevel’s curvature. Go figue I messed up my grinding angle, damn thing is suppoded to be flat….

“Why not make something calculate the angle for you?” rightly spoke the engineer in the back of my mind. “All I needed was to display the tilt of the knife somehow, it will be a fun warmup!”

The project lasted from the April 20th 2021 to the October 11th 2021: total project time 15 days and .72 hours.

Heads up. I am not a good essay writer, so kindly forgive any amature mistakes.
